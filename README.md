1. "How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?" (SNHU, 2023)

Listening to the users is important because each user has an idea of what they need. By listening to them, I’m allowing myself to take in what they’re saying, what I can see as useful, and what multiple users are saying. Often times they are building up on each other and you can find the common element that they are asking for. This is where creating user stories comes to play. When gathering the information, you’re listening to what the user has to say and breaking each into a smaller piece. An example from the project that we were doing was the creation of a top 5 vacation list. Multiple people in the focus group spoke about having such a list and, as they spoke, refined what they were looking for and building off of each other. This led to them wanting it based on their vacation history or on the types of vacations they prefer. This gave us more points that putting into individual user stories that explained what they were looking for, why it was useful, and what was needed to accomplish that particular piece as important. It let us have specific user stories, such as a story just for wanting to be able to get vacations to the preferred type. That told us we needed to be able to let users select their vacation type. That would then display a top list from what they actually preferred.

2. "How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?" (SNHU, 2023)

Generally, when I approach developing a program, I break it down into smaller tasks. This works well in creating backlog elements as I can more easily see what is more likely to take more time, what is a ‘smaller’ element to work on, and how long I can generally work on this. In the agile processes, I would say that the one I definitely take with me into the future would be the agile estimation process. This is because I’ve seen that being able to estimate different portions of a project into smaller elements that can be in the backlog gives me the best way to see what can be done in a timeframe and the overall timeframe.

3. "What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?" (SNHU, 2023)

To be a good team member in development, I have to be able to work with others. I need to be able to help when one of my coworkers needs help with something they may have less experience with. I need to be able to take on tasks and constantly learn new things while asking the appropriate questions. I have to be able to answer questions so that everyone knows what is happening. It’s not about being a solo member who does things and then leaves everyone high and dry. I need to be able to work with everyone so that we can all succeed.
